# Django Budget Web App

Creating a Django Web App utilizing [The Dumbfounds video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgTFa8rdGg4&list=PLbpAWbHbi5rNUuLTzreCl1g212G7qgzpR&index=4)
its a little more complex than the other Django tutorial but I'm happy I did the other one firs.  This one is at a much faster pace.
